### 3. Questions
**1. Does previous state (or dominant) religion have an significant impact on the formation or conceptualization of a national community?**
  + ex. on social attitudes, state policy, political rights
  
**2. Is political cohabitation possible? If so, how should state sovereignty be dealt with in multicultural states?**
  + ex. Sami peoples (Nordic countries), Inuit peoples (Denmark)

.pull-left[.body2[
**3. How to reconcile with a  violent past? Is myth-making really an effective nation-building tool?**
  + ex. anti-semitism in Romania, Serbian-Bosnian frictions in Kosovo  
  + Are shared life experiences under difficult times what truly shape national identity?]]
